# My First and Simple Git Repository

This is my first attempt to create a Git repository on GitHub.
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository. 
I am interesteed (among other things) in:
- Creating a branch
- Working on the branch and committing my changes.
- Merging the branch to `main`.
